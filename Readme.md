# Paolo's FMX Components for Delphi

I'll put here FMX components I need for my developments, when required, without any plan. Please, visit this page now and then to see if there are new components.  

## TplFmxClock
** Tested with Delphi 10.1 for Win32 and Win64 **  
The TPlFmxClock is an analog, digital or mixed clock. It is designed to be used as timer for soccer matches, but you can use it as a classic clock too.  
TplFmxClock descends from TCircle. It contains an engine for the analog clock and a separate, independent engine for the digital clock. You can combine them to get nice efffects.  
A demo illustrates its properties.  

### TODO
